This is my implementation of an FM index for my Computational Genomics research project
to learn more about FM index: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fm_index

to run:
python fmindex.py /path/to/file_containing_text_to_index.txt

//TODO
efficient suffix sort - specifically DC3.
occurences of string
longest reoccuring substring
most occuring substring of given length
